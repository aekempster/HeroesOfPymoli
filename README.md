Three observable trends:

1. while women make up less than 20% of the player base, theyre is not a major difference in the amount they spend on the game. Men, who make up more than 80% of the player base spend on average just $0.19 more. 
2. The 20-24 age group is by far the largest, making up almost 40% of the entire player base. 
3. The difference between player count (573) and total purchase count (780) indicates that there is a decent number of repeat buyers - 207 purchases were a players second or more purchase.
