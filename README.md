Three observable trends:

1. There is no major observable difference in the amount of money players are willing to spend based on their gender. While men make up more than 80% of the player base, they are only spending on average $0.19 more than women players.

2. The 20-24 age group is by far the largest, making up almost 40% of the entire player base. 

3. The difference between player count (573) and total purchase count (780) indicates that there is a decent number of repeat buyers - 207 purchases were a players second or greater purchase.
